The purpose of this extension is to allow for the use of the QUIC Bit by later extensions.

本扩展的目的是允许QUIC位被用于将来的扩展中。

Extensions to QUIC that define semantics for the QUIC Bit can be negotiated at the same time as the grease_quic_bit transport parameter. In this case, a recipient needs to be able to distinguish a randomized value from a value carrying information according to the extension. Extensions that use the QUIC Bit MUST negotiate their use prior to acting on any semantic.

可以在协商传输参数`grease_quic_bit`的同时协商是否使用为QUIC位定义语义的QUIC扩展。
在这种情况下，接收方需要有能力分辨随机值和按照扩展传递信息的值。
使用QUIC位的扩展{{< req_level MUST >}}在使用值的语义前先协商它们的用途。

For example, an extension might define a transport parameter that is sent in addition to the grease_quic_bit transport parameter. Though the value of the QUIC Bit in packets received by a peer might be set according to rules defined by the extension, they might also be randomized as specified in this document.

例如，某扩展可能定义一个与传输参数`grease_quic_bit`一起发送的另一个传输参数。
尽管对端接收到的数据包中的QUIC位可能一开始是按照扩展定义的规则来设置的，但在发送前它们可能按照本文档的规定经过了随机化。

The receipt of a transport parameter for an extension that uses the QUIC Bit could be used to confirm that a peer supports the semantic defined in the extension. To avoid acting on a randomized signal, the extension can require that endpoints set the QUIC Bit according to the rules of the extension but defer acting on the information conveyed until the transport parameter for the extension is received.

如果终端接收到了某使用了QUIC位的扩展所定义的传输参数，那么它就能确信对端支持扩展中定义的语义。
为了避免对随机值作出反应，扩展可以要求终端按照扩展的规则来设置QUIC位，但是推迟对传递的信息做出反应，直到接收到该扩展定义的传输参数。

Extensions that define semantics for the QUIC Bit can be negotiated without using the grease_quic_bit transport parameter. However, including both extensions allows for the QUIC Bit to be greased even if the alternative use is not supported.

可以不使用传输参数`grease_quic_bit`来协商是否使用为QUIC位定义语义的扩展。
然而，同时使用这两种扩展使得QUIC位能在其替代用途不受支持的情况下仍能得到转义。
