This document introduces no new security considerations for endpoints or entities that can rely on endpoint cooperation. However, this change makes the task of identifying QUIC more difficult without cooperation of endpoints. This sometimes works counter to the security goals of network operators who rely on network classification to identify threats; see Section 3.1 of [MANAGEABILITY] for a more comprehensive treatment of this topic.

本文档为终端或依赖终端协作的实体引入新的安全风险。然而，该变更使得分辨QUIC的任务在没有终端协作的情况下变得更加困难。这有时与网络运营商依靠网络分类来识别威胁的安全目标背道而驰；有关此话题更全面的分析，详见《[QUIC可管理性]()》的[第3.1章]()。
